As part of our group's activities, we were pleased to invite  **Prof. Pham Ngoc Nam** from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) is going to give a talk on his research. Prof. Nam is now a visiting researcher at the UoA.

 

**Biography**: Pham Ngoc Nam received B. Eng. Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (Vietnam) and M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence from K.U. Leuven (Belgium) in 1997 and 1999, respectively. He was awarded a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from K.U.Leuven in 2004. From 2004 until now he has been working at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. His research interests include QoS/QoE management for multimedia applications, reconfigurable embedded systems and low-power embedded system design. Since 2008 he has been a Vice Dean of the School of Electronics and Telecommunications, HUST.

 

**Title**: Mapping scalable multimedia applications on embedded reconfigurable platforms

 

**Abstract**: Advanced multimedia applications usually consist of multiple scalable audio-visual objects, each of which may have different quality levels. Depending on the network bandwidth as well as the processing capacity of the user device, the quality of the objects can be adjusted in such a way that the overall quality of service (QoS) perceived by the user is maximized. In addition, with a very fast advancing in FPGA technology, FPGA based platforms will be able to be reconfigured dynamically and partially at run-time. The run-time reconfigurability allows the hardware platforms to adapt themselves to meet the processing requirement of the applications. In this talk, I will present different research topics related to the mapping of scalable applications on embedded reconfigurable platforms.
