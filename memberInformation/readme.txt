Need file for converting

- memberInformation.csv (original member information list)

When you convert the csv file by convertMemberInformation.rb, please use this command:

$ ruby convertMemberInformation.rb > output.txt

After converting, copy the table in the output.txt, and then paste the copied text in target file.
(Maybe, the target file is "members.markdown")
